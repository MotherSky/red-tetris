userUUID in spectatorArea is always undefined??
in spectatorArea, the username passed to GridBoard is never used
in gameSlice: init, rotate, and moves are all the same



bonus:

// [x] - score
// [x] - random username

// [ ] - space to goDown buttom
// [ ] - Have a persistence of these scores for each player.
// [ ] - chat emojis
